Just for brief information, my real name is Joko Riyadi, I was born and raised also lives in Jakarta Indonesia. The reason I have the nickname "jadol" or "mbahjadol" to use is because it was used from my past when I was in college. And why until now I still use it, it's just because I think it's cool. LOL.
