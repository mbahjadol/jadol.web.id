After a long time I have never worked on my personal site, it seems like it's time to start changing the look of this site. Although the best people who visit this site are only search engine robots, or AI search, but at least it's still a little manageable. heheheh.

Actually, I've known this hugo for a long time, but I haven't really gotten to know him in depth like this hugo, how his underneath is, how to use it, and even how to put it on the web. Well, it's worth it when you have a free little time, it's not going to take long for us to invade it, just try to change my personal site.

Here's what you want to see in my front page.

hehehe yes at least it's more modern, compared to my old personal site which is still full static, style of 15 years ago hahahah.

Okay, here it is, later on, if I have free time, I will to try to make a blog for how to make this site.
